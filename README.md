# findMusic
 This is a utility script to make you spend less time looking for music before starting to work. Simply enter how random you want results (0 for first result, anything up to 100 for more potential options), then enter what you would search for normally on YouTube (e.g. 1 lofi jazz).

 #Set Up
 Create a .env file with your YouTube API key.
 Go to the findMusic.bat file and put the appropriate file path before the "findMusic.pyw" (e.g. C:\Users\Sriram\python\findMusic.pyw, no quotation marks needed)
 Add the directory where the repo has been cloned to your PATH variable in order to be able to use the utility from any directory
